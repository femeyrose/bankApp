http client is used to create http requests 
this is like in postman we use modules for the requests
so http client is the angular module

we have imported the http client module in app.module.ts firstchanges are made in register.ts and data.services.ts


.subscribe is an observable just like .then (.then is a promise)
we have to subscribe the observable.
in the first part of subscribe we get success, and in the second part we get the error msg
promise- gives only one result
but observable-multiple result

cors- browser feature
this is security feature
we run the browser runs at 4200
first time when the browser runs, chrome will not allow to run to port 3000 after we integrate express and Angular
server should say to run the from 4200 to 3000
for that we need to allow cors in the server
this should be mention in index.js of express

note: in the failure cases eg:in register -acc already exits, we need the status code 422 (given as data.error.message)
we connect to the bank end to front end angular, we can see the message in the browser which is coded in the backend


component interaction
=============================
we have created a component (ng g c deleteConfirmation) for this
used the selector of deleteConfirmation (in its ts file) in the transactions.html for using it

since delete selector is inside the transaction, transaction is parent and delete is child

'transactions' is a parent component and 'deleteConfirmation' is its child component
to display- are you want to delete <id> ?, we define @input in delete-confirmation.ts
@Input is a decorator in Angular 
we take the data from child component using @Input and passes it to the child component (we passes id to child from parent using @input id:string)
we have used this id in the transactions.html and pass this to the child's html (delete.html) as {{id}}
pages are passed using services

data (id) is passed from parent to child-we use @Input decorator

if we pass from child to parent- @output decorator

when the delete button (given in child) is clicked, alert message appears (with id (id is an event here) taken from child) this is using @output (from child to parent)

(onDelete)="onDelete($event)" is used in transaction.html, when this is clicked, parent function is called (bcz onDelete($event) is defined in the transaction)


whenever parent component changes it will affect the child also, they are binded

why input output given in child component

Angular Directivies
========================
ng g d directives/highlight 
//custom created directive here is highlight

component vs directives

directives- has no html file,it has only ts file
eg:to highlight any thing in a tag eg:transaction history, use selector in the transaction.html
add ElementRef in the constructor of highlight.ts and import from @angular core
ElementRef-element reference here h1 tag in transaction.html

component is also a directive

angular has 3 directives:
1. components-these have templates
2. attribute directive (changes given to the already existing ones)-element's appearance/behaviour can be changed eg:highlight attribute directive
3. structural directives-changes the DOM ie, ngFor,ngIf will add/delete ie, changes the structure-elements can be added/deleted to the html
eg:ngIf, if true-add the element to html
false-delete the element from html

main benefit of directives (highlight used here), we can reuse anywhere to change a particular tag color, size,alert/any other fuctionalities

[ngClass],[ngStyle]- built in attribute directive in angular,so we can use this directly, no need of defining any where-conditionaly class can be enabled


Animations in angular
=================================
ng g c animationDemo

for having animations, we should give the details in @component decorator of animationDemo.ts
