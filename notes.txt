http client is used to create http requests 
this is like in postman we use modules for the requests
so http client is the angular module

we have imported the http client module in app.module.ts firstchanges are made in register.ts and data.services.ts


.subscribe is an observable just like .then (.then is a promise)
we have to subscribe the observable.
in the first part of subscribe we get success, and in the second part we get the error msg
promise- gives only one result
but observable-multiple result

cors- browser feature
this is security feature
we run the browser runs at 4200
first time when the browser runs, chrome will not allow to run to port 3000 after we integrate express and Angular
server should say to run the from 4200 to 3000
for that we need to allow cors in the server
this should be mention in index.js of express

note: in the failure cases eg:in register -acc already exits, we need the status code 422 (given as data.error.message)
we connect to the bank end to front end angular, we can see the message in the browser which is coded in the backend
